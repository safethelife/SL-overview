## About The Project
SL offers a secure and innovative platform for users to register their medical imaging, leveraging blockchain technology for sharing and analyzing these images. Users receive coin rewards for image registration, and can obtain free diagnoses through SL Foundation's AI analysis. Additionally, users can seek second opinions from third-party AIs using coins, participate in medical data exchange, and engage in governance voting and staking with annual rewards.
